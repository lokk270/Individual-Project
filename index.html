                        <h4>Background</h4>
                        <p>This work was created in 2022 for the 2nd "Secondary School Cultural Creativity Cup" short video competition. The competition aimed to encourage young people to document the times through images and showcase the creativity and thinking of contemporary secondary school students. Our team chose the theme of humanistic care during the pandemic, hoping to convey warmth and hope through the short film.</p>

                        <p>This is a 5-minute narrative short film about ordinary people helping each other during the pandemic. As the team's photographer and editor, I was responsible for capturing emotionally rich scenes and weaving them into a touching story. The work ultimately won second prize out of 26 films.</p>

                        <p>Participating in professional filming for the first time was both exciting and nerve-wracking. Through this competition, I learned how to tell stories through visual language, especially how to showcase the brilliance of humanity during special times like the pandemic. During the editing process, I discovered that the selection and duration of each shot would affect the audience's emotional experience, which sparked my strong interest in film production.</p>

                        <h4>Project Background</h4>
                        <p>This film was a key promotional project for the 2023 school exchange program with mainland universities, aiming to showcase Hong Kong's cultural characteristics and higher education achievements. As the team's assistant director, photographer, and editor, I participated in the entire process from pre-production planning to post-production.</p>

                        <h4>Brief Introduciton</h4>
                        <p>This is an 8-minute promotional exchange film that uses Victoria Harbour as a thread to connect Hong Kong's education, culture, and urban landscape. The film was shot at multiple universities in Hong Kong and along both sides of Victoria Harbour, ultimately being sent as official exchange material to partner universities in mainland China.</p>

                        <h4>Creative Challenges</h4>
                        <p>The most memorable part was the 12-hour continuous shoot along Victoria Harbour, where we needed to capture different scenes during sunrise, daytime, and night within a limited time. As the assistant director, I had to coordinate locations, schedules, and personnel arrangements, which was a great test of my organizational and problem-solving skills.</p>

                        <p>This experience gave me a deep understanding of the creative logic and rhythm control of promotional films. Compared to my first work, I made significant progress in shot composition and narrative structure, and also learned how to better cooperate and communicate within a team.</p>

                        The bronze award recognized the team's professional growth. Practicing multiple roles from production assistant to editor helped me build a systematic understanding of film production and clarified my future specialization direction. This experience proved that persistence and teamwork can create results beyond expectations.
